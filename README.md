# Telegram Mini Apps — a catalog that is actually maintained

Every entry is re-checked automatically every week. Not just "does the URL
return 200" — for Telegram links the check confirms the bot still **exists**
(Telegram serves a normal 200 page for deleted bots, so naive link checkers
report them as healthy), and for GitHub links it reports how long the project
has been untouched.

**Submissions get a decision within 7 days.** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **29 apps**, last verified **2026-10-05**
- **3** flagged as inactive — listed, but marked, not quietly left to rot
- Machine-readable copy: [`data/apps.json`](data/apps.json)
- Every entry records who contributed it and when it was last checked

## For listed authors

If your app is here, you are welcome to show it. See [BADGE.md](BADGE.md) for a
copy-paste snippet.

## Where these entries came from

Most of this list started as pull requests that had been sitting unmerged for
months in [telegram-mini-apps-dev/awesome-telegram-mini-apps](https://github.com/telegram-mini-apps-dev/awesome-telegram-mini-apps).
Those projects were real and their authors had done the work, so they are
carried over here with the original wording and credited to whoever submitted
them. Each entry's `sourcePR` field in `data/apps.json` points back to the
original pull request.

If you are one of those authors and would rather not be listed, open an issue
and the entry comes out, no questions asked.

## Who maintains this

This catalog is maintained by the people behind StoriesFly, which is itself
listed under Products. It sits under exactly the same rules as everything else,
with no preferential placement, and it is flagged in the data with a
`maintainerNote` so nobody has to take that on trust.

The reason for saying so plainly: a directory whose owner quietly ranks himself
first is worth nothing to anyone.
